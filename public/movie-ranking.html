<h1> The Best Anime series according to Nikhil buddu </h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime series all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>one-piece</h3>
<p>There are no words to describe. It is simply breadth taking.</p>
<h3>Dragonball</h3>
<p>Friendship is the best gift you can get. It is so emotional.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>The protogonist role broke the limits of the anime and took it so far. It definitely will have a special place in my heart. Naruto is my inspiration to work hard until you reach what you desire for.</p>
